Module 13 assignment

You can find my code for this challenge under M13_Starter_Code --> spam_detector.ipynb.

In this assignemnt we used a spam data set to train a logistic regression model and a random forest model and then we were asked to compare the accuracy scores. I found that the rf model outperformed the lr model by .01.
